# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cavan Donohoe

I am a data scientist who specializes in R
programming. I discovered R programming in 2019 (can you believe that
was 6 years ago??) and have loved it since then. I have a whole project
list on my website listed below and a little bit more about me if youâ€™d
like to read on.

Iâ€™m currently in a phase of my life where I would love to help with some
small projects that might need some reproducibility. In this crazy world
of high tech AI and incredibly fast computers, why are some people still
relying on entire workflows in Excel? It boggles my mind ðŸ¤¯

R has become a passion of mine and I would love to share that passion
with you.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in helping peopleâ€™s lives easier.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new ways in R to make that achievable.
